# Vocabulary-training-tool

I developed a custom-built vocabulary-training tool,Designed to help me improve my English language skills for my upcoming Israeli SAT test. As I had no prior knowledge of programming languages such as python or SQLITE, I utilized GUI development tools to create a user-friendly graphical interface that allowed me to easily create and manage my own custom word lists.

This project has been made in 2020.
